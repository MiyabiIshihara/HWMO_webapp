<h3 id="Explore">Explore your area</h3>

On this tab you can find out hazard information for individual communities.
Scroll down or start typing an island to select where you want to learn about. Find your community in hte Area drop down list.
Hazard scores are divided into 5 categories:
<ol>
  <li>Subdivision (eg, the arrangement of houses and roads)</li>
  <li>Fire Protection (eg, access to the fire department and related agencies)</li>
  <li>Vegetation (eg, the impact of local trees and brush on fire hazard) </li>
  <li>Building (eg, how fire resilient typical buildings in the community are)</li>
  <li>Fire environment (eg, environmental conditions like rainfall)</li>
</ol>
Select a hazard category and then an individual hazard in order to see the score for the community you selected.

Note that explanations for how each community was scored are right underneath.


<h3 id="Action">Take action</h3>

The take action tab provides information about what you can do to increase fire resilience in your community and across Hawai'i. Take a look at our videos and lots of links!
This page also contains links to all our social media sites if you want to connect with us.

For more detailed information about the data contained in the web app, go to the About page. Here is also more information on how we think you might use the app and license information if you want to use our data in your own projects.

<h3 id="Data">Data downloads</h3>
[IMAGE]
If you are interested in looking at data from across the state in a table format, go to the data downloads tab where you can look at the original data used to make the map as well as download it. There are two sub-pages under the Data Downloads tab, Community Meeting Info and Hazards. 
<h4>Community Meeting Info</h4>
Here is where you can look at all the priorities identified in community meetings about wildfire awareness. Pick a focus and a Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP) region to sort the data, then click the download button on the upper right to receive either all or subset you've selected. The download comes in a comma separated values (CSV) format.
<h4>Hazards</h4>
This works just like the Community Meeting Info download page except for hazard data. Notice how you can sort the table columns such that you can either look for a specific community alphabetically or organize the table by hazard score.

Here are links to the HWMO main website and to the code we used to build the app!
