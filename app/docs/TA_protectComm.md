Everything is easier when more people are involved. You don't need to feel alone in your quest to reduce wildfire risk in your neighborhood. Here are some ways to come together with your neighbors. Power in numbers!

<h4> National Community Wildfire Preparedness Day </h4>
Organize a community work day or outreach event in your neighborhood for [National Community Wildfire Preparedness Day](https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/Campaigns/National-Wildfire-Community-Preparedness-Day). Every year, the first Saturday of May is National Community Wildfire Preparedness Day. Work with your friends, family, and neighbors to raise awareness about wildfire, hold evacuation drills, clean up flammable vegetation, plant native trees... the possibilities are endless. Each year, there is a competitive grant from State Farm and NFPA that is available and is worth applying for. 

<h4> Firewise Community Certification </h4>
Become a nationally-recognized Firewise Community. Starting in July 2015, HWMO began working with communities statewide to help them achieve Firewise Community Certification. The recognition program is part of a nationwide effort of over 1,400 (and counting) working towards a common goal: protecting the community from wildfire. In 2014, Kohala-By-the-Sea was still the only Firewise Community in the state. Their amazing efforts have lasted over a decade... but we thought, why not go all out and shoot for at least 10 in two years?

We have done just that. HWMO has assisted 10 communities on Hawaii Island and Maui to help them achieve national Firewise Communities recognition. There are 4 more on the way and we welcome more communities to join a growing movement.

As a nonprofit organization, our mission is to support your wildfire protection efforts, so we work hard to secure grant and donated funds to provide these services at no cost to you or your community. Becoming a nationally-recognized Firewise Community is an excellent step toward safeguarding your family, home, and neighborhood. Additionally, the certified Firewise Communities across Hawai ªi have opportunities to get together, support each other, and learn from one another.
