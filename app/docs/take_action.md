Protecting our lands, waters, and communities from wildfire in Hawaii takes a collective effort. Thankfully there are proactive and passionate people like you who want to help. Here are some great ways to take action!

**Raise Awareness About Wildfire in Hawaii:**
Help us get the word out about Hawaii's wildfire issues and about your stories and successes in dealing with wildfire in your community. Let's spread the message like wildfire!

Scan through our enormous online [Resources Library](http://www.hawaiiwildfire.org/fire-resource-library). You'll find information on everything from equipment safety, home drills, parental guides, Firewise landscaping, and more. 

Download a copy of the [Ready, Set, Go! Wildland Fire Action Guide](http://www.hawaiiwildfire.org/fire-resource-library-blog/rsg-your-personal-wildland-fire-action-guide) that will take you through every step of wildfire planning in and around the home before a wildfire and what you should do if a wildfire is in your area. If you'd like a free, shiny hard-copy of the guide, you can send us an e-mail to <admin@hawaiiwildfire.org> or stop by our office in Kamuela or one of your local fire stations. 

We provide an incredible and unique service that will help you better understand the wildfire hazards around and on your home. Per your request, we can send a highly trained member of our staff to perform a home assessment and offer solutions to help reduce those wildfire hazards.

**Protect Your Community**
Everything is easier when more people are involved. You don't need to feel alone in your quest to reduce wildfire risk in your neighborhood. Here are some ways to come together with your neighbors. Power in numbers!

Organize a community work day or outreach event in your neighborhood for [National Community Wildfire Preparedness Day](https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/Campaigns/National-Wildfire-Community-Preparedness-Day). Every year, the first Saturday of May is National Community Wildfire Preparedness Day. Work with your friends, family, and neighbors to raise awareness about wildfire, hold evacuation drills, clean up flammable vegetation, plant native trees... the possibilities are endless. Each year, there is a competitive grant from State Farm and NFPA that is available and is worth applying for. 

Become a nationally-recognized Firewise Community. Starting in July 2015, HWMO began working with communities statewide to help them achieve Firewise Community Certification. The recognition program is part of a nationwide effort of over 1,400 (and counting) working towards a common goal: protecting the community from wildfire. In 2014, Kohala-By-the-Sea was still the only Firewise Community in the state. Their amazing efforts have lasted over a decade... but we thought, why not go all out and shoot for at least 10 in two years?

We have done just that. HWMO has assisted 10 communities on Hawaii Island and Maui to help them achieve national Firewise Communities recognition. There are 4 more on the way and we welcome more communities to join a growing movement.

As a nonprofit organization, our mission is to support your wildfire protection efforts, so we work hard to secure grant and donated funds to provide these services at no cost to you or your community. Becoming a nationally-recognized Firewise Community is an excellent step toward safeguarding your family, home, and neighborhood. Additionally, the certified Firewise Communities across Hawai ªi have opportunities to get together, support each other, and learn from one another.
