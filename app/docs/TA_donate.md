Our small non-profit of 6 passionate staff members is charged with serving the entire State of Hawaii and parts of the Western Pacific. Extensive partnerships and grant opportunities help us accomplish such amazing projects, but we are constantly searching for ways to keep our operations going and to expand our project list. By donating to HWMO, you can help keep our flame alive.
