We are a small non-profit made up of 6 passionate staff members who are charged with serving the entire State of Hawaii and parts of the Western Pacific. We are able to accomplish such amazing projects due to our extensive partnerships and grant opportunities, but we are constantly searching for ways to keep our operations going and expanding our project list. By donating to HWMO, you can help keep our flame alive.
